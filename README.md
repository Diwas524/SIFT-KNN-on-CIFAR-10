# SIFT-KNN-on-CIFAR-10
 In this blog post, we've demonstrated a powerful approach to image classification using SIFT features and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This method brings together traditional computer vision techniques and modern machine learning, resulting in highly accurate image categorization.
