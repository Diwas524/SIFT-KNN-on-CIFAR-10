    "The provided code loads the CIFAR-10 dataset, applies SIFT feature extraction to images, constructs a codebook using MiniBatchKMeans clustering, computes Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) representations, trains a K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier, and evaluates scene recognition accuracy. It starts by preprocessing and loading the CIFAR-10 dataset. Then, it extracts SIFT features from the images, creates a codebook for clustering these features, and computes BoVW representations for both training and testing data. A K-NN classifier is trained on the training data, and its accuracy is evaluated on the test data, with results including accuracy and a classification report. Hyperparameters like the number of clusters, batch size, and the number of neighbors can be adjusted to optimize performance."
